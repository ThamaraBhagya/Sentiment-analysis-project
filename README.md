Sentiment analysis project

I built a Sentiment Analysis model that classifies tweets into positive and negative comments. This project allowed me to dive into the end-to-end ML pipeline, gaining hands-on experience with a range of tools and techniques, from data preprocessing to deployment. 🚀

🔹 Project Breakdown:<br>
✅ Dataset: Collected real-world tweets from Kaggle 📊<br>
✅ Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and structured the data using Pandas and NumPy for better accuracy 🛠<br>
✅ Tokenization: Split tweets into individual tokens (words) to extract meaningful information 🔑<br>
✅ Feature Engineering: Extracted relevant features using TF-IDF vectorizer to convert text into numerical data 🧮<br>
✅ Model Building: Implemented various classification models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM to classify sentiment 🎯<br>
✅ Model Evaluation: Fine-tuned models and used cross-validation for better performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall) 📈<br>
✅ Deployment: Developed and deployed the app using Flask, making the predictions live on the web! 🌐
